   DESCRIPTITON:
     Reverse generator for "Bejeweled" game.
     Program works with a field of "gems". When 3 or more same "gems" are in
     straight line right next to each other, the triplet disappears. If there
     were other gems above those who vanished, they "fall down". (Like in a
     Bejeweled game)

     This program gets board with remaining "gems" placed (no more triplets can
     be made) and it fills the playing board back - move by move - in such a
     way, that there will always be *only one* solution for the whole game.
