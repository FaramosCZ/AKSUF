MATHEMATIC MODEL

The moves will be generated from the final game result (input to the program)
to the beginning of the game. (Gems placed on every field)

First, we'll father input to the program and check, that the size of the
playing board is correct. Ideally, the input will be fully filled bottom row,
and the playing filed would have multiple of 3 as a height.

Then, we'll need to generate the first triplet. It is a special one, beacuse
all other triplets will operate with the latest triplet placed before them.
Make sure, there is no move or "move one swap away" available other than the
placed triplet. If there would be more, the game would not be deterministic.

Once first triplet is generated, every other will be placed in following way:
Take the last triplet and place the new next to it. They must touch atleast
with single side, corner is not enough.
Check, if there are only 2 moves or "moves one swap away" on the board
(the last placed and newly placed)
Make swap between those 2 triplets and check again, there is only 2 options.
(the last placed and newly placed, now both one swap away)

By this algorith, every new triplet will be bound to the last, which will
create a chain of triplets where one triplet solved, enable solving of another
one.
The checks after every triplet addition and after every swap will assure,
that the chain will be deterministic.
